My brother and I spent many months designing and coding our website Unravel The Music.  We decided that it is now effectively worthless because the API we used for gathering lyrics was recently sued and shutdown for copyright infringement.  We weren’t really aware that this was a major risk for us and one that we were really willing to take on. 

We therefore decided that since this is a hobby site and we are unable to afford licensing for lyrics the site is essentially valueless and we are looking for something else to put our time into (if you have any ideas or support we’d love to hear it).
Since we no longer really plan on pursuing this website any longer I wanted to offer up to the community many examples of codeigniter code.  While some of them may not be “best practice” I feel they still get the job done well.

So, if you want to see examples of the following things plus much much more check out the source, let us know how we did, what you think and anything else on your mind.

User activity feed
Journals
Blog
Most disccused lists
User Karma system
Multiple APIs
Memcached integration
Searching
Cataloging
User profiles
AJAX and jQuery examples
File uploading (thumbing and resizing)
Comment voting
Threaded comments
Artist/Album/Song Tagging
Amazon integration
Issue Reporting
Power User management console
Admin console

We could try to set it up as a music blog and spotlight interview site but there are just so many of them already we don’t see how we can be competitive as we can’t be dedicated writers and we are both in school and working.  Therefore I hope you learn something from our work.

So please any comments, tips, concerns or whatever, just leave them below.

Please note if you are looking at songs/view the lyrics section has been intentionally crippled to not work.

Edit:
I’ve actually decided to start a simple wordpress blog to share and explain some of the code in a much more structured format rather than a source code dump.  Hope you all enjoy it.
